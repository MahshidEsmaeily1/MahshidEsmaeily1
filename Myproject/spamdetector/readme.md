SMS Spam Detection Analysis

This repository contains a Python script for analyzing a dataset of SMS messages labeled as either “spam” or “ham” (non-spam). The script explores the dataset and extracts insights regarding message length, label distribution, and specific message details.

Features of the Code:
1. Loading and Preprocessing Data:

• The dataset is loaded from a plain text file (tab-separated format).
• The file should contain two columns:
• Label: Indicates whether the message is spam or ham.
• Message: The content of the SMS.

2. Feature Engineering:
• A new column, LenOfMessage, is added to calculate the length of each message.

3. Descriptive Statistics:
• Displays summary statistics for the dataset and grouped statistics based on Label.
• Shows the frequency counts of spam and ham messages.

4. Visualization:
• Plots a histogram of message lengths, grouped by Label.

5. Longest Spam Message:
• Identifies and displays the longest spam message in the dataset.

Requirements:
• Python libraries:
• pandas for data processing.
• matplotlib for plotting.


How to Use:
1. Ensure the dataset file is named SMSSpamCollection and placed in the working directory.
2. Run the script to:
• Analyze the statistics of SMS messages.
• Visualize the distribution of message lengths.
• Retrieve specific details like the longest spam message.
